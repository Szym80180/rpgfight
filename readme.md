# RPG Fight
## Main assumptions
1. The characters have 3 stats: ATT, DEF, CON
2. YOu have 30 stat points to use on the stats
3. ATT points give you a bonus to attack rolls.
4. DEF points set the difficulty for hitting a target.
5. CON points add bonus HP

## Rolls
DND like
1. To perform an action you "roll a die" - a random number between 1 and 20 is generated.
2. Stats give you bonuses - 1 additional point to your attack roll for every 4 stat points
3. CON adds 1 HP for every 2 points
4. Damage dealt is based on damage roll (d10)

## How the game works
1. Initiative roll - each side rolls a d20, higher = better. On a tie stats decide in order ATT>CON>DEF.
2. Player 1 chooses an action: Attack, Defend (maybe later Parry)
3. Attack: Roll a d20, add ATT bonus, compare with enemy DEF, roll a damage dice, calculate enemy HP.
4. Defence: Boost your DEF by half of your CON points, standby.
5. Check if Player 2 is dead > End game/Continue.
6. Player 2 chooses an action: Attack, Defend
7. Check if Player 1 is dead > End game/Continue.
8. Loop till the game ends
